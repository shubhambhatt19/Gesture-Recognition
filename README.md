# Gesture-Recognition


Smart TV comes up with the some additional feature like gesture recognition. Every hand gestures says something, for e.g. if I will swap the hand on left it could mean 
that I want to change the jump backward by 10 seconds and so on.

In this Problem statement we have to identify the 5 hands movement as followed:

Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
Left swipe: Jump backwards 10 seconds
Right swipe: Jump forward 10 seconds  
Stop: Pause the movie
